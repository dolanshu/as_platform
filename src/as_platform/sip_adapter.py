"""Thin wrapper around the sippy primitives.

This is the only place, together with the call controller, that is allowed to touch sippy
objects. Everything above the adapter talks in plain Python values, so the use-case logic
stays testable without a stack (``AGENT.md`` section 12).

The URI and header handling here follows RFC 3261: a Request-URI of the form
``sip:user@host`` and the ``P-Asserted-Identity`` header carrying the calling party on an
IMS trunk (3GPP TS 24.229).

    """Cancel every per-transaction timer of a sippy transaction manager.

    ``SipTransactionManager.shutdown()`` cancels only its own cache-purge timer
    (``cp_timer``) and releases the UDP sockets, so every timer a transaction still owns
    stays armed in the process-wide ``ED2`` loop, which nothing stops with the manager.
    Such a timer fires into a manager whose ``global_config`` is already ``None`` and
    raises ``TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`` in ``transmitData`` —
    which is exactly why a retransmission that was pending when a manager stopped could
    break an unrelated test sharing the same loop. Cancelling them first makes the
    shutdown complete.

    It has to happen *before* ``shutdown()``: that call drops the transaction tables the
    timers hang from, so afterwards there is nothing left to walk.

    A server transaction only carries the timer attributes its own branch of RFC 3261
    uses, so a missing attribute is skipped rather than treated as an error. An attribute
    left pointing at a timer that has already fired is skipped too: ``ED2`` nulls the
    callback when a timer has run, so the timer is dead and only the reference remains.

    Args:
        transaction_manager: A sippy ``SipTransactionManager``, live or already stopped.
