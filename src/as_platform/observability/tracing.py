"""Per-Call-ID trace, console event feed and SIP message recording.

Every event of both call legs is recorded under the SIP Call-ID, which is the
correlation key for logs, console and acceptance evidence (``AGENT.md`` section 4.3 and
4.8). The recorder is fed by the sippy glue and drained by the internal API.

:class:`SipMessageRecorder` additionally captures the verbatim SIP messages sippy writes.
It is what makes message samples real instead of hand-written: the capture tooling points
the stack at a recorder and stores what actually went on the wire (``AGENT.md``
section 7).
